// Snapshot A's outputs to plain serializable values inside its DO
// context, then apply them in B's. The caller drives the two passes
// via a snapshot and apply callback pair.
//
// This is the workerd shape; the node-side withTwoDBs runs both
// callbacks in the same process with two real SQLiteTestStorage
// instances. Tests that need the simpler signature should branch on
